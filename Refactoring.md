# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

During refactoring, I sought to improve clarity and understandability whilst minimizing the complexity of the function. This meant breaking down the function's operations into logical segments which are easier to digest. I placed focus towards explaining the logic through the code itself, along with comments for additional context. Having clear, separate sections for each conditional check ensures a straightforward, step-by-step path of execution for a reader to follow. By using a helper function, `hashData`, I isolated the complex hashing operation, making the main function cleaner and its purpose clearer. Each decision was made with the primary aim to make the function's workings transparent, and i believe these changes make the function notably more approachable and easy to understand for any developer reading the code.
